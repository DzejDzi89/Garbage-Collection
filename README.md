# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant custom sensor for monitoring regular garbage collection schedule. The sensor can be configured for number of different schedules:
- `weekly` schedule (including multiple collection days, e.g. on Tuesday and Thursday)
- `every-n-weeks`
- bi-weekly in `even-weeks` or `odd-weeks` (technically, it is the same as every 2 weeks with 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> first_week)
- `every-n-days` (repeats regularly from the given first date). If n is multiply of 7, it works similar to `weekly` or `every-n-weeks`, with the difference that it ignores the week numbers (that restart each year) but continues infinitely from the initial date.
- `monthly` schedule (n<sup>th</sup> day each month), or a specific day of each n<sup>th</sup> week. Using the `period` it could also be every 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> etc month.
- `annually` (e.g. birthdays). This is once per year. Using include dates you can add additional dates manually.
You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection), by configuring the first and last month. 
And you can `group` entities, which will merge multiple schedules into one sensor.

These are some examples using this sensor. The Lovelace config examples are included below.

## Installation

### MANUAL INSTALLATION
1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bruxy70/garbage_collection/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/garbage_collection` directory
   into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant
   installation.
3. Configure the `garbage_collection` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### INSTALLATION VIA Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)
1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Search for and install the "Garbage Collection" integration.
3. Configure the `garbage_collection` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
There are 2 ways to configure the integration:
1. Using *Config Flow*: in `Configuration/Integrations` click on the `+` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the sensor (prefered). If you configure Garbage Collection using Config Flow, you can change the entity_name, name and change the sensor parameters from the Integrations configuration. The changes are instant and do not require HA restart.
2. Using *YAML*: add `garbage_collection` integration in your `configuration.yaml` and add individual sensors. Example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: "Regular waste" # Each week on Monday and Wednesday. No collection on Christmas, added extra collection on the 27th
    frequency: "weekly"
    collection_days:
    - mon
    - wed
    exclude_dates:
    - '2019-12-25'
    include_dates:
    - '2019-12-27'
  - name: "Bio-waste" # Bi-weekly (odd weeks) on Thursday. Between March and November
    frequency: "odd-weeks"
    first_month: "mar"
    last_month: "nov"
    collection_days: "thu"
  - name: "Large waste summer" # First and third Saturday each month
    frequency: "monthly"
    collection_days: "sat"
    weekday_order_number: 
    - 1
    - 3
    first_month: "may"
    last_month: "oct"
  - name: "Large waste winter" # First Saturday each month only
    frequency: "monthly"
    collection_days: "sat"
    weekday_order_number: 
    - 1
    first_month: "nov"
    last_month: "apr"
  - name: "Large waste" # Combination of winter and summer sensors
    frequency: "group"
    entities:
    - sensor.large_waste_summer
    - sensor.large_waste_winter
  - name: Paper # Every 4 weeks on Tuesday, starting on 4th week each year
    frequency: "every-n-weeks"
    collection_days: "tue"
    period: 4
    first_week: 4
  - name: "Someone's Birthday" 
    frequency: "annual"
    date: '11/24'
```
Entity_id change is not possible using the YAML configuration. Changing other paratemers require restarting Home Assistant.

### CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
#### SENSOR PARAMETERS
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
| `name` | No | Sensor friendly name
| `frequency` | Yes | `"weekly"`, `"even-weeks"`, `"odd-weeks"`, `"every-n-weeks"`, `"every-n-days"`, `"monthly"`, `"annual"` or `"group"`

| `icon_today` | Yes | Icon if the collection is today **Default**: `mdi:delete-restore`
| `icon_tomorrow` | Yes | Icon if the collection is tomorrow **Default**: `mdi:delete-circle`
| `verbose_state` | Yes | The sensor state will show collection date and remaining days, instead of number **Default**: `False`
| `verbose_format` | Yes | (relevant when `verbose_state` is `True`). Verbose status formatting string. Can use placeholders `{date}` and `{days}` to show the date of next collection and remaining days. **Default**: `'on {date}, in {days} days'`</br>*When the collection is today or tomorrow, it will show `Today` or `Tomorrow`*</br>*(currently in English, French, Czech and Italian).*
| `date_format` | Yes | In the `verbose_format`, you can configure the format of date (using [strftime](http://strftime.org/) format)  **Default**: `'%d-%b-%Y'`


#### PARAMETERS FOR ALL FREQUENCIES EXCEPT ANNUAL
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
| `collection_days` | No |Day three letter abbreviation, list of `"mon"`, `"tue"`, `"wed"`, `"thu"`, `"fri"`, `"sat"`, `"sun"`. 
| `first_month` | Yes | Month three letter abbreviation, e.g. `"jan"`, `"feb"`...<br/>**Default**: `"jan"`
| `last_month` | Yes | Month three letter abbreviation.<br/>**Default**: `"dec"`
| `exclude_dates` | Yes | List of dates with no collection (using international date format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`. 
| `include_dates` | Yes | List of extra collection (using international date format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`.
| `move_country_holidays` | Yes | Country holidays - the country code (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) for the list of valid country codes).<br/>Automatically move garbage collection on public holidays to the following day.<br/>*Example:* `US`   
| `prov` | Yes | Country holidays - province (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).
| `state` | Yes | Country holidays - state (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).
| `observed` | Yes | Country holidays - observed (see [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) ).

#### PARAMETERS FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-WEEKS
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`period` | Yes | Collection every `"period"` weeks (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1
|`first_week` | Yes | First collection on the `"first_week"` week (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1<br/>*(The week number is using [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) numeric representatio of the week)<br/><br/>Note: This parameter cannot be used to set the beginning of the collection period (use the `first_month` parameter for that). The purpose of `first_week` is to simply 'offset' the week number, so that the collection every n weeks does not always trigger on week numbers that are multiply of n. Technically, the value of this parameter shall be less than `period`, otherwise it will give weird results.*


#### PARAMETERS FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-DAYS
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`period` | Yes | Collection every `"period"` days (warning - in this configuration it is days, not weeks!)<br/>**Default**: 1 (daily, which makes no sense I suppose)
|`first_date` | No | Repeats every n days from this first date<br>(date in the international ISO format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`).


#### PARAMETERS FOR MONTHLY COLLECTION
The monthly schedule has two flavors: it can trigger either on the **n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of the weekday** in a month, or on the weekday in the **n<sup>th</sup> week** of each month.

|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`weekday_order_number` | Yes | List of week numbers of `collection_day` each month. E.g., if `collection_day` is `"sat"`, 1 will mean 1<sup>st</sup> Saturday each month (integer 1-5)<br/>**Default**: 1
|`week_order_number` | Yes | Similar to `weekday_order_number`, but instead of n<sup>th</sup> weekday of each month, take the weekday of the n<sup>th</sup> week of each month.</br>So if the month starts on Friday, the Wednesday of the 1<sup>st</sup> week would actually be last Wednesday of the previous month and the Wednesday of 2<sup>nd</sup> week will be the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of the month.
|`period` | Yes | If `period` is not defined (or 1), the schedule will repeat monthly. If `period` is 2, it will be every 2<sup>nd</sup> month. If `period` is 3, it will be once per quarter, and so on.<br/>The `first_month` parameter will then define the starting month. So if the `first_month` is `jan` (or not defined), and `period` is 2, the collection will be in odd months (`jan`, `mar`, `may`, `jul`, `sep` and `nov`). If `first_month` is `feb`, it will be in even months. (integer 1-12)<br/>**Default**: 1

*You cannot combine both `weekday_order_number` and `week_order_number` options in one sensor - if you configure both, it will only take the `week_order_number` parameter.*

#### PARAMETERS FOR ANNUAL COLLECTION
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`date` | No | Date of the collection using format `'mm/dd'` (e.g. '11/24' for November 24 each year)

#### PARAMETERS FOR GROUP
|Attribute |Optional|Description
|:----------|----------|------------
|`entities` | No | List of `entity_id`s to merge


**IMPORTANT - put include/exclude dates within quotes. Dates without quotes might cause Home Assistant not loading configuration when starting - in case the date is invalid. Validation for dates within quotes works fine.** I think this is general bug, I am addressing that. (See the example above)

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES
### State
The state can be one of

| Value | Meaning
|:------|---------
| 0 | Collection is today
| 1 | Collection is tomorrow
| 2 | Collection is later 

If the `verbose_state` parameter is set, it will show date and remaining days, for example "Today" or "Tomorrow" or "on 10-Sep-2019, in 2 days" (configurable)

### Attributes
| Attribute | Description
|:----------|------------
| `next_date` | The date of next collection
| `days` | Days till the next collection

# Lovelace config examples

## Garbage Collection custom card
You can use the custom  [garbage collection card](https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card) developped by @amaximus.

<img src="https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card/blob/master/garbage_collection_lovelace.jpg">


## With images (picture-entity)
This is what I use (I like images). I use a horizontal stack of picture-entities, with `card-templater` plugin ([Lovelace Card Templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater)) to show number of days:

<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/picture-entity.png">

(The `state` is designed to be used like traffic lights, this is why it has 3 values. You obviously cannot use this with `verbose_state`)

This is the configuration
```yaml
      - type: 'custom:card-templater'
        card:
          type: picture-entity
          name_template: >-
            {{ states.sensor.bio.attributes.days }} days
          show_name: True
          show_state: False
          entity: sensor.bio
          state_image:
            "0": "/local/containers/bio_today.png"
            "1": "/local/containers/bio_tomorrow.png"
            "2": "/local/containers/bio_off.png"
        entities:
          - sensor.bio
```

## List view (entities)
The simplest visualisation is to use entities. In this case, I use `verbose_state` to show `state` as text.

<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/entities.png">

Integration configuration (you can customise state text by `verbose_format` and `date_format` parameters)
```yaml
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: General Waste
    frequency: 'weekly'
    collection_days: wed
    verbose_state: True
  etc...
```
Lovelace configuration
```yaml
      - type: entities
        entities:
        - sensor.general-waste
        - sensor.bio
        - sensor.large-waste
```

## Icon view (glance)
<img src="https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/sensor.png">

Integration configuration
```yaml
garbage_collection:
  sensors:
  - name: General Waste
    frequency: 'weekly'
    collection_days: wed
    verbose_state: True
    verbose_format: "on {date}\n(in {days} days)"
  etc...
```

Configuration (I use style (by card-mod plugin) to allow line-break in the state)
```yaml
      - type: glance
        style: 
          ".entity": 
            $: |
             :host {}
             div:nth-of-type(2) {
               white-space: inherit !important
             }
        entities:
          - sensor.smes
          - sensor.bioodpad
          - sensor.papir
          - sensor.plasty
```
